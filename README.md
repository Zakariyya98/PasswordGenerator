This build was inspired by the Frontend Mentor Password Generator App.

The motivation for this build was to enhance my knowledge and create
something that can be showcased on my profile. It has also been deployed
to Netlify and is available to view at the link [Insert Link Here]

It can be used on Desktop, Tablets and Mobile and is responsive across all
of these devices.

THE GENERATED PASSWORDS ARE RANDOM AND ARE NOT STORED ANYWHERE. ALL SOURCE
CODE IS AVAILABLE TO VIEW IN THE COMMIT HISTORY FOR YOU TO BROWSE THROUGH
SHOULD YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HOW THIS WAS BUILT.

Please Note:
This WebApp is a POC (Proof of Concept) and should not actively be used to
generate your passwords, if you do decide to use this password generator
I will not be held liable for any loss of data or loss of access to your
accounts.

Please use https://www.passwordmonster.com/ to test the strength of the
password as the strength meter that is bundled with this app is just a
POC. The strength meter is basic and based off of the selected
character sets.
