# Please Note:

This WebApp is a POC (proof of concept) and should not be actively used to
generate your passwords. If you do decide to use this password generator,
I will not be held liable for any loss of data or loss of access to your
accounts.

Please use https://www.passwordmonster.com/ to test the strength of the
password, as the strength metre that is bundled with this app is just a
POC. The strength metre is basic and based on the selected
character sets.
